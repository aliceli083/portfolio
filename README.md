# Portfolio
## Description
My portfolio contains my information, my projects, and my contact information. The purpose of the portfolio is to give recruiters and and employers an overview of me as an applicant. The process of the project includes building an html and css page from scratch and designing it myself. I've made the website mobile and tablet responsive so the format can be viewed appropriately from different viewports.
